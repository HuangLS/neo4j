/**
 * A read/write lock is a lock that will allow many transactions to acquire read
 * locks as long as there is no transaction holding the write lock.
 * <p>
 * When a transaction has write lock no other tx is allowed to acquire read or
 * write lock on that resource but the tx holding the write lock. If one tx has
 * acquired write lock and another tx needs a lock on the same resource that tx
 * must wait. When the lock is released the other tx is notified and wakes up so
 * it can acquire the lock.
 * <p>
 * Waiting for locks may lead to a deadlock. Consider the following scenario. Tx
 * T1 acquires write lock on resource R1. T2 acquires write lock on R2. Now T1
 * tries to acquire read lock on R2 but has to wait since R2 is locked by T2. If
 * T2 now tries to acquire a lock on R1 it also has to wait because R1 is locked
 * by T1. T2 cannot wait on R1 because that would lead to a deadlock where T1
 * and T2 waits forever.
 * <p>
 * Avoiding deadlocks can be done by keeping a resource allocation graph. This
 * class works together with the {@link RagManager} to make sure no deadlocks
 * occur.
 * <p>
 * Waiting transactions are put into a queue and when some tx releases the lock
 * the queue is checked for waiting txs. This implementation tries to avoid lock
 * starvation and increase performance since only waiting txs that can acquire
 * the lock are notified.
